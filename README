Sorting Algorithms
==================

This is a basic framework for functional sorting-algorithms.  They are
a prototype for an implementation in a faster language and designed to
run on multiple processors.

The modules:
-- baselist:
   Base classes for functional recursive sorting algorithms.

-- basesort:
   A data-type for sorting-function.

-- help:
   Helper Functions to realise various primitive operations.

-- interfaces:
   Contains the visitor interface for an abstraction of all common
   function on the list data-type and the manager for this type. 

-- listman:
   To play around with the list, we are trying to hide state behind
   this man.

-- sorting algorithms:
   Implemented algorithms at the time are:
   -- selection sort,
   -- insertion sort,
   -- merge sort,
   -- quick sort.
